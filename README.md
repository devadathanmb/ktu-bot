```

## Local development setup

- NOTE :
  1. If you don't want or don't want to work on the `notification` feature and don't want to setup the database, then just comment out the corresponding calls in `app.ts` and skip the **firebase** configuration part below.
  2. The bot makes use of [BullMQ](https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq), a redis based nodejs queue, for the live notifications feature. Thus, it requires you to have a redis db instance running. The docker compose method below already does that for you.

### Running Locally (Without Docker - Not preferred)

1. Install Node.js and npm on your machine.
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devadathanmb/ktu-bot.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd ktu-bot
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Set up your Telegram bot token:

   - Create a new bot on Telegram using the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
   - Copy the bot token.
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:

     ```env
     BOT_TOKEN="your-telegram-bot-token"
     ```

     See [env.example]("./env.example") file for example

6. Create a Firebase project and setup a Firestore database in [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)

7. Download the `serviceAccountKey.json` file, `minify` it and `base64` encode it using

   ```bash
   jq -r tostring serviceAccountKey.json  | base64
   ```

8. Copy the `base64` encoded `serviceAccountKey.json` string to `.env`

   ```
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="base64 encoded string"
   ```

9. Set the `ENV_TYPE` variable to `DEVELOPMENT` in `.env`

   ```
   ENV_TYPE="DEVELOPMENT"
   ```

10. Build the bot:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

11. Start the bot:

The bot should now be running and accessible on Telegram.

## Production setup

This bot makes use of Telegram bot API's [webhook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks) mechanism in production.

This is because of certain performance benefits that webhook offers with high concurrent load during peak times. For more info see [this](https://grammy.dev/guide/deployment-types#how-to-use-webhooks).

**NOTE : Using webhooks in production is optional but recommended if your bot has heavy concurrent traffic. If you don't want to setup webhooks, just follow the above development setup guide and you are good to go.**

### Pre-requisites

To run the bot using webhooks in production, some pre-requisites are required. They are mentioned below:

- A VPS
- A domain
- SSL certificate for the domain (you can use [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for that)
- Docker
- A reverse proxy (like [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/))

**NOTE : The below guide makes use of _nginx_ as the reverse proxy and assumes that you have reverse proxy configured for the webhook endpoint with HTTPS traffic handling**

1. Set up an nginx reverse proxy for the webhook endpoint. See [this](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/) for more information. Checkout basic example in [webhook.conf](./webhook.conf)

2. Clone the repository using

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devadathanmb/ktu-bot.git && cd ktu-bot/
   ```

3. Set `ENV_TYPE=PRODUCTION` in `.env` file. See [env.example](./env.example)

4. Make sure to add all necessary environment variables to `.env` mentioned in [env.example](./env.example)

5. Build and run the docker using `docker compose up -d`

6. Start the nginx server (eg : `sudo systemctl restart nginx`)

That's it. Your bot should be running now in webhook mode.
